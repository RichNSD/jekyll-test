# Jekyll Theme Testing

Experimenting with creating a Jekyll Theme from scratch, following the [documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) on the official [Jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/).


<br />

## Documenting Progress

As I proceed I will be creating my own __Wiki Documentation__ which will be posted (at least for now) both in this repository's __[Wiki](https://github.com/RichNSD/jekyll-test/wiki)__ as well as in the (hopefully functional) __[GitHub Pages Site](https://richnsd.github.io/jekyll-test)__.
